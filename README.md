# prompts-and-support-files
This is the code collection for the article "Method for Constructing Knowledge Graphs Using Domain Knowledge Constraints and Guidance in Large Language Models," which includes six files in total:
(1) ontology construction.py: This is the code for ontology construction. The ontology construction process does not call APIs but is instead done directly through the GPT-4 chat window. This file demonstrates two prompts for ontology construction.
(2) NER.py: This file contains the prompts and Python code for extracting entities from electronic medical records.
(3) RE.py: This file includes the prompts and Python code for relation extraction based on the extracted entities.
(4) Knowledge filling.py: This file contains the prompts and Python code for filling the extracted entities into the ontology categories.
(5) Entity disambiguation.py: This file contains the prompts and Python code for entity disambiguation.
(6) Primary Lung Cancer Surgical Clinical Pathway Form.pdf: This is the form for the national standard clinical pathway for non-small cell lung cancer.
